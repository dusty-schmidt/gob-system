Title: Grid Overwatch Bridge
Purpose: Bridge service enabling communication between grid monitoring and GOB systems.
Owner/Contact: DS
Status: Active

Interfaces
- Inputs: Grid data stream (TBD), config/state
- Outputs: Logs under logs/, events to GOB controller (planned)
- APIs/CLI: Python service.py entrypoint

Dependencies
- Internal: lib/state_manager (import path corrected)
- External: Python runtime and requirements

Config & Secrets
- .env variables as needed
- Config files in component directory

Runbook
- Build: pip install -r requirements.txt (project root) or component-specific
- Run: python service.py (ensure PYTHONPATH includes component path)
- Test: Simulate grid data input
- Troubleshoot:
  - Known Issue (fixed): NameError due to incorrect import path; resolved by appending service directory to sys.path

Health & Observability
- Logs: component logs directory and root logs/
- Ports: N/A
- Metrics: N/A

Risks & TODOs
- Formalize module packaging to avoid sys.path hacks
- Define message schema to GOB controller
