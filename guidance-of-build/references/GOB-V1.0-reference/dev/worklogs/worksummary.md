## ðŸš¨ Development Guidelines

**Core Rule**: Always reference `dev/references/agent-zero/` before modifying core functionality files  
**Philosophy**: GOBV1's value is in UX improvements, not core rewrites  
**Safe to Modify**: `scripts/gob`, `setup.sh`, `docs/`, `dev/`  
**Require Reference**: `agent.py`, `models.py`, `python/`, `webui/`, `agents/`
