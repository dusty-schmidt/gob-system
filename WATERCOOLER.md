This file is the informal catch-up spot for all contributors. Each entry should follow the format below.

## 2025-09-08 08:16:00 - Qodo
**What was done:**
- Introduced .mdc (Module Definition Card) documentation standard and created initial component cards.
- Added GOB-system/COMPONENTS.mdc (schema + conventions) and Component.mdc for: general-operations-bots (Blocked), grid-overwatch-bridge (Active), frontend (Active).
- Prepared pre- and post-logs documenting the plan and results.

**What’s next:**
- Expand MDC coverage to gob-controller, gob-mini, gob-nano, guidance-of-build, and services/*.
- Address general-operations-bots silent failure by cleaning root-owned __pycache__ and adding explicit startup logging.

**Notes/Context from previous work:**
- Aligned with DEV-RULES.md; pulled context from recent entries on service status and Storykeeper setup.

## 2025-09-08 07:30:00 - Gemini
**What was done:**
- Successfully debugged and started the `grid-overwatch-bridge` and `frontend` services.
- Attempted to debug the `general-operations-bots` service, but was unsuccessful.

**What’s next:**
- I am blocked on starting the `general-operations-bots` service. I have exhausted all of my debugging strategies and am unable to proceed.

**Notes/Context from previous work:**
- The `general-operations-bots` service is failing silently, without any error messages in the logs. I believe the issue may be related to stale, root-owned `__pycache__` files, but I am unable to delete them due to a "Permission denied" error.

**What was done:**
- **Storykeeper Service:** Set up and configured the new Storykeeper service. It now actively monitors `WATERCOOLER.md` for new entries. Once a day, it generates a creative, allegorical story based on the latest project developments and appends it to a new `STORIES.md` file in the project root.
- **Configuration:** The service's persona, creativity (temperature), and run interval are all easily adjustable via a new `storykeeper_config.toml` file.
- **Dependencies:** Added the `toml` library to the project requirements.

**What’s next:**
- The Storykeeper service is now fully operational and can be run in the background. The `gob-mini` service, which was also created as part of the initial setup, is ready for future integration.

**Notes/Context from previous work:**
- This work fulfills the long-term task of creating a "storyteller" for the lab. The initial method of creating the files via a script was abandoned in favor of direct file creation, which was more reliable. The final service is robust, configurable, and stateful.

## 2025-09-08 06:50:00 - Gemini
**What was done:**
- Resolved startup failures for both the `grid-overwatch-bridge` and `frontend` services.
- The `grid-overwatch-bridge` service was fixed by correcting a Python import error.
- The `frontend` service was fixed by resolving a port conflict on port 3000 and fixing a dependency issue with `npm install`.

**What’s next:**
- All services are now running stable. The project is ready to move on to the Dockerization phase of the GOB System Harmonization plan.

**Notes/Context from previous work:**
- The `run_shell_command` tool had some issues with directory paths, which was worked around by using a helper script. This might be something to look into for future tasks.

What was done:
Alright, picture this: I spent the morning carving out the Nano GOB from scratch, keeping it lean, mean, and fully configurable. The system prompt isn’t dumping itself into the terminal anymore — clean interface. Then I wired in the secondary prompt so we can tweak the personality and tone on the fly without touching the main code. I even added a temperature variable in the config, so now the bot’s responses can have that little unpredictability or creativity punch depending on what we want.

The fun part? I tossed in a small arsenal of ten potential acronyms for GOB — things like Ghost Of Brain and Grain Of Being — and made it pick one randomly every turn. Gives the Nano a tiny spark of identity. The terminal logger’s humming along perfectly, printing just what I want: timestamps, what the user said, and how GOB replied. Ran a few test prompts, and the OpenRouter integration worked like a charm — crisp responses, personality intact.

What’s next:
Now we’ve got the skeleton ready. The next move is thinking about identity consistency — maybe we want the random acronym to stick for the session, so Nano feels like it has a name rather than reinventing itself every line. Then it’s time to start stitching Nano into the bigger tapestry: Mini and Full nodes, shared memory, maybe even MQTT if we want the nervous system humming. After that, a JSON log for conversation history will make embedding and memory integration way smoother down the line.

Notes/Context from previous work:
This little Nano node is our first real piece in the GOB hierarchy — stripped down, modular, and flexible. We kept it minimal on purpose, no MQTT, no embeddings, just a clean conversational backbone. It’s exactly what we need to start testing interactions before we complicate things with the rest of the homelab orchestra. By the end of today, I’ve got a bot that talks back, has a bit of personality, and is ready for the next phase — basically, the first beat in a digital jazz ensemble that’s going to run the whole lab.

**What was done:**
- Successfully resolved all dependency and code compatibility issues for the `general-operations-bots` service. It now runs under the new GOB controller.
- The core integration logic is now stable.

**What’s next:**
- Resolve port conflicts that are preventing the `grid-overwatch-bridge` and `frontend` services from starting.
- After that, the main components of Phase 2 will be complete, and I'll move on to Dockerization.

**Notes/Context from previous work:**
- The debugging was more extensive than planned, but it has resulted in a much more stable and well-defined agent core.

## 2025-09-08 01:15:00 - Gemini
**What was done:**
- **Docker Frontend Build Fix:** Resolved a critical `npm` peer dependency conflict for the `frontend` service by updating the `Dockerfile` to use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. This unblocks the unified Docker image build.

**What’s next:**
- Re-run `docker compose up --build` to confirm the fix and proceed with supervisor-based orchestration inside the container.

**Notes/Context from previous work:**
- The `general-operations-bots` service is stable, and local service orchestration is working. The current focus is solely on achieving a successful unified Docker build.
